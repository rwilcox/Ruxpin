Racket Scribble Format is my reference format developed here:

https://github.com/rwilcox/my-learnings-docs/blob/master/scribble-utils.rkt

Why? Because other referene formats didn't seem to let me pin down page number or original texxt (??) I can't believe this isn't a soved problem but here we are.

It also gives us a way to, in Racket, save references t a file. Theoreticaly this could et us round-trip a reference.
